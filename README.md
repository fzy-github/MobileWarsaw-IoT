Gentle introduction to IoT and mobile development


# Project description
This project demonstrates IoT development using an ESP32 microcontroller with Wi-Fi and BLE. The ESP32 reads soil moisture levels from a connected sensor and transmits the data via Bluetooth advertisement packets.

A iOS mobile app scans for nearby Bluetooth devices, decodes the moisture data from the ESP32, and displays it in a simple interface. This project combines IoT, BLE communication, sensor integration, and mobile app development.
